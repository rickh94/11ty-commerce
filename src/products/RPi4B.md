name: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2019 Quad Core 64 Bit WiFi Bluetooth (4GB)
description: 'Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the latest product in the popular Raspberry
  Pi range of computers. It offers ground-breaking increases in processor speed, multimedia
  performance, memory, and connectivity compared to the prior-generation Raspberry
  Pi 3 Model B+, while retaining backwards compatibility and similar power consumption.
  For the end user, Raspberry Pi 4 Model B provides desktop performance comparable
  to entry-level x86 PC systems. This product’s key features include a high-performance
  64-bit quad-core processor, dual-display support at resolutions up to 4K via a pair
  of micro-HDMI ports, hardware video decode at up to 4Kp60, 4GB of RAM, dual-band
  2. 4/5. 0 GHz wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5. 0, Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3. 0, and PoE
  capability (via a separate PoE HAT add-on). The dual-band wireless LAN and Bluetooth
  have modular compliance certification, allowing the board to be designed into end
  products with significantly reduced compliance testing, improving both cost and
  time to market. Operating temperature: 0 – 50 degrees C ambient. '
